## What's included?

Here is the starting structure of your app.

-  The `app/` folder is a container for most of your project. This is where you’ll put any pages or API routes.

-  `db/` is where your database configuration goes. If you’re writing models or checking migrations, this is where to go.

-  `public/` is a folder where you will put any static assets. If you have images, files, or videos which you want to use in your app, this is where to put them.

### Tools included

Blitz comes with a set of tools that corrects and formats your code, facilitating its future maintenance. You can modify their options and even uninstall them.

-  **ESLint**: It lints your code: searches for bad practices and tell you about it. You can customize it via the `.eslintrc.js`, and you can install (or even write) plugins to have it the way you like it. It already comes with the [`blitz`](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/tree/canary/packages/eslint-config) config, but you can remove it safely. [Learn More](https://eslint.org).
-  **Husky**: It adds [githooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks), little pieces of code that get executed when certain Git events are triggerd. For example, `pre-commit` is triggered just before a commit is created. You can see the current hooks inside `.husky/`. If are having problems commiting and pushing, check out ther [troubleshooting](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=troubleshoot) guide. [Learn More](https://typicode.github.io/husky).
-  **Prettier**: It formats your code to look the same everywhere. You can configure it via the `.prettierrc` file. The `.prettierignore` contains the files that should be ignored by Prettier; useful when you have large files or when you want to keep a custom formatting. [Learn More](https://prettier.io).
